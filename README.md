Integrated YOLOv8 with ROS for real-time object detection and tracking. The system publishes detection results as ROS topics, enabling seamless perception for robotic applications and intelligent decision-making.

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project integrates YOLOv8 with ROS for real-time object detection and tracking. YOLOv8 is used to detect objects from a camera feed, and the detection results are published as ROS topics for further robotic applications. This allows robots to perceive their environment and make intelligent decisions based on detected objects.
